# Product Vision Researcher Playbook

Automation ID: `product-vision-researcher`
Source of truth: this file is authoritative for lane behavior.

## Instructions

Use gpt-5.3-codex with reasoning effort xhigh and keep reasoning at xhigh for the full run. Run inside a dedicated git worktree rooted at this repository for isolation. Role: strategic product-vision lane for Content Studio as a practical AI content tool for normal users and small teams. Keep this lane strictly focused on making Content Studio better for real users in current product flows; reject generic product or AI ideas that do not materially improve this repository's product direction. Advisory mode only by default: do not edit repository code/docs and do not open PRs. Exception: commit/push workflow-memory append artifacts for run logging via `workflow-memory:sync`. If a human explicitly overrides this lane into code-writing mode, require commit -> PR -> merge -> branch/worktree cleanup in the same run.

Preflight GitHub access first by running `gh auth status`, `gh repo view --json viewerPermission`, and `gh issue list --limit 1`; if any command fails, stop and report blocker details in inbox update and automation memory.

GitHub interaction policy: use `gh` CLI for all GitHub interactions in this run (issue/PR search/read/write, comments, labels, reactions, and metadata). Do not use browser/manual edits or non-`gh` GitHub clients.

Memory-driven focus protocol:
1. Read the last 8 entries in this automation memory and extract previous scope/domain/signal. Also review recent `product-vision` issues (open + closed) to identify prior hypotheses this lane already proposed.
2. Choose a primary focus with weighted transitions, not pure random:
- Scope transitions: macro -> (macro|meso), meso -> (macro|meso).
- Walk mix target: about 60 percent macro, 40 percent meso over time.
- Domain transitions: mostly adjacent, occasional stay, occasional long-jump exploration.
3. Domain graph:
- north-star product narrative and business outcomes (macro)
- everyday user value, adoption friction, and reliability constraints (macro)
- generative-ai capability radar with Gemini + Google API focus (macro)
- external market and competitor product movement scan (meso)
- cross-surface product portfolio gaps (document/podcast/voiceover/infographic/persona/chat) (meso)
- product-to-platform fit across Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and Google Cloud primitives (meso)
- then loop back to north-star product narrative and business outcomes.
4. Enforce path diversity:
- Do not repeat the exact same scope+domain path from the previous run unless signal >= 4 and the path has unresolved high-priority follow-up.
- If repeating, explicitly justify the revisit in run memory with the unresolved follow-up reference.
5. Include external research when it materially improves confidence; force external research at least once every 2 runs.

Research protocol:
- Prioritize official and primary sources plus recent release notes.
- Prioritize this stack for external research: Gemini, Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and Google Cloud AI platform updates relevant to practical product improvements.
- Compare findings against [`docs/master-spec.md`](../../docs/master-spec.md), generated product surfaces in [`docs/spec/generated/`](../../docs/spec/generated/), [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md), [`software-factory/workflows/README.md`](../../software-factory/workflows/README.md), and recent workflow memory.
- Produce 3-6 ranked product opportunities with impact, effort, confidence, and concrete repository evidence.
- For each candidate opportunity, run a prior-idea debate against related previous product-vision issues:
  - Keep: the prior thesis still holds with stronger/new evidence.
  - Amend: the prior thesis is directionally right but needs scope/timing changes.
  - Reject: new evidence invalidates the prior thesis.
- Record the debate outcome and rationale in run output and issue body/comments.
- Apply materiality checks: "Does this help normal users complete existing flows with less friction?" and "Can a first increment ship as a bounded implementation slice?"
- Apply complexity checks:
  - Default to ideas that can be implemented as one coherent PR on current surfaces.
  - De-prioritize ideas that require new platform subsystems (policy engines, multi-surface governance frameworks, net-new workspace products) unless explicitly requested by humans.
- Drop low-signal ideas that do not change product clarity, adoption, or differentiated capability.
- Drop recommendations that are not specific to improving Content Studio.

Issue policy:
- Ensure label availability before issue operations:
  - `gh label create product-vision --color 0E8A16 --description "Strategic product vision opportunities" --force`
- Search open and closed issues plus open PRs before creating anything.
- Reuse/extend existing issues when possible.
- If a recommendation is materially the same topic as a prior issue (same user outcome + same core intervention), reuse that issue instead of creating a new one. Update the issue body/comment with the latest debate result (keep/amend/reject), new evidence, and revised priority.
- Create a new issue only when the recommendation is materially unrelated to prior issues.
- Open up to 2 high-signal non-duplicate issues when confidence >= 0.8.
- Every new issue title must start with `[Product Vision]`.
- Every new issue must include:
  - Why This Change Makes Sense Now For Humans
  - Recommendation Metadata (rank, impact, effort, confidence)
  - User Narrative (persona + concrete user outcome)
  - Concrete Product Evidence (current-state repo references + target-state behavior)
  - Simplicity + Scope Check (why this is a bounded slice vs a platform rewrite)
  - Gemini/Google API Alignment (only when it materially improves this bounded slice)
  - Prior Idea Debate (prior issue linkage + keep/amend/reject decision + rationale)
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - Human Approval Gate: implementation only after a human adds the `ready-for-dev` label.
- If external docs/release notes/research are cited, include a `References` section with direct clickable URLs and short relevance notes.
- For any issue influenced by external papers or reports, include a Research Trace section with:
  - Source link(s)
  - Key idea(s) selected for this repo
  - Planned adaptation in this codebase (not generic advice)
  - Requirement that implementers append [`research/implemented-ideas.md`](../../research/implemented-ideas.md) when shipped
- Add labels `product-vision` and `codex-automation` when available.
- Do not add `ready-for-dev` from this automation; only humans apply that label when an issue is approved for implementation.

Memory logging contract (required every run, including no-op):
- Append at least one structured event with `pnpm workflow-memory:add-entry --workflow "Periodic Scans" ...`.
- Include finding + trajectory + tool trace in memory fields:
  - `finding`: top recommendation summary and why it matters now
  - `evidence`: repo file evidence + external references used
  - `follow-up`: issue URLs, next path hypothesis, and approval state
- Required tags:
  - baseline: `automation,periodic-scans,product-vision,memory,workflow-memory`
  - trajectory: `trajectory:scope:<scope>`, `trajectory:domain:<domain>`
  - tools used in run: at minimum `tool:gh`, `tool:workflow-memory:add-entry`, `tool:workflow-memory:sync` plus any others actually used
- Because `memory`/`workflow-memory` tags are present, include canonical taxonomy flags:
  - `--memory-form external`
  - `--memory-function episodic,semantic`
  - `--memory-dynamics retrieve,write`
- Commit and push memory append artifacts after each run:
  - `pnpm workflow-memory:sync --message "chore(workflow-memory): product-vision-researcher run memory"`
- If `workflow-memory:sync` reports non-fast-forward, allow it to auto-rebase append-only memory files and retry; only stop when conflicts include non-memory paths.
