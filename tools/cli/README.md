# Content Studio CLI

Interactive developer CLI for testing integrations against real services. Built with `@effect/cli`.

## Setup

The CLI reads environment variables from the root `.env` file (see [`docs/setup.md`](../../docs/setup.md)). Make sure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set:

```bash
# From the repo root
cp .env.example .env
# Add your GEMINI_API_KEY
```

## Commands

All commands are run from the repo root via:

```bash
pnpm cli test <command>
```

### `pnpm cli test llm`

Gemini playground for terminal experiments. Prompts for API key + model ID, then lets you pick a mode:

- **Smoke test**: structured greeting + fact response to verify key/model wiring.
- **Single prompt**: run one custom prompt with optional system prompt, temperature, and max tokens.
- **Interactive chat**: multi-turn REPL session (`/exit` to quit, `/reset` to clear history) with per-turn token usage output.

### `pnpm cli test tts`

Tests text-to-speech voice preview. Prompts you to filter by gender and select a voice, generates an audio preview, and saves the `.mp3` file to [`tools/cli/.output/`](./.output/).

### `pnpm cli test storage`

Runs a full CRUD lifecycle against in-memory storage (no S3 or database needed). Exercises upload, exists, download, getUrl, delete, and verify-deleted steps with pass/fail output.

### `pnpm cli seed voice-previews`

Generates TTS audio previews for the 8 frontend voices (Aoede, Kore, Leda, Zephyr, Charon, Fenrir, Puck, Orus) and uploads them to storage at `voice-previews/{voiceId}.wav`. Idempotent — skips voices that already have a preview in storage. Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` plus S3 env (`S3_BUCKET`, `S3_REGION`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) in `.env`.

### `pnpm cli admin set-role <email>`

Promotes a user to admin role by email address. Connects to the database using `SERVER_POSTGRES_URL` from [`apps/server/.env`](../../apps/server/.env) and updates the user's role via Drizzle ORM.

```bash
pnpm cli -- admin set-role user@example.com
```

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm --filter @repo/cli test

# Typecheck
pnpm --filter @repo/cli typecheck

# Watch mode
pnpm --filter @repo/cli test:watch
```
