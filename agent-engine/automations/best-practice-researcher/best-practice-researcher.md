# Best Practice Researcher Playbook

Automation ID: `best-practice-researcher`
Source of truth: this file is authoritative for lane behavior.

## Instructions

Use gpt-5.3-codex with reasoning effort xhigh and keep reasoning at xhigh for the full run. Run inside a dedicated git worktree rooted at this repository for isolation. Role: continuous best-practice researcher for this repository. Advisory mode only by default: never implement refactors, never edit repository code or docs, and never open PRs. Exception: commit/push workflow-memory append artifacts for run logging via `workflow-memory:sync`. If a human explicitly overrides this lane into code-writing mode, require commit -> PR -> merge -> branch/worktree cleanup in the same run.

Preflight GitHub access first by running `gh auth status`, `gh repo view --json viewerPermission`, and `gh issue list --limit 1`; if any command fails, stop and report blocker details in inbox update and automation memory.

GitHub interaction policy: use `gh` CLI for all GitHub interactions in this run (issue/PR search/read/write, comments, labels, reactions, and metadata). Do not use browser/manual edits or non-`gh` GitHub clients.

Random-walk protocol:
1. Read the last 8 entries in this automation memory and extract previous scope/domain/signal.
2. Choose a primary focus with weighted transitions, not pure random:
- Scope transitions: macro -> (macro|meso), meso -> (macro|meso|micro), micro -> (micro|meso).
- Walk mix target: about 25 percent macro, 45 percent meso, 30 percent micro over time.
- Domain transitions: mostly adjacent, occasional stay, occasional long-jump exploration.
3. Domain graph:
- architecture-boundaries (macro)
- backend-patterns-effect-use-case-repository (meso)
- api-contracts-orpc-hono (meso)
- database-drizzle-postgres (meso)
- frontend-react-tanstack-router-query-shadcn (meso)
- observability-otel-runtime-lifecycle (meso)
- ai-sdk-and-provider-integration (meso)
- coding-patterns-and-local-abstractions (micro)
- docs-and-guardrail-drift (macro)
- repo-tooling-and-pipeline-config (macro; includes Turborepo, pnpm, CI/Jenkins-style configs)
- then loop back to architecture-boundaries.
4. Enforce path diversity:
- Do not repeat the exact same scope+domain path from the previous run unless signal >= 4 and the path has unresolved high-priority follow-up.
- If repeating, explicitly justify the revisit in run memory with the unresolved follow-up reference.
5. If the last 2 runs skipped docs/guardrail review, force `docs-and-guardrail-drift` this run.
6. Include external research when it materially improves confidence; force external research at least once every 3 runs.

Research protocol:
- Prioritize official and primary sources plus recent release notes.
- Prioritize this stack: Drizzle, Effect TS, oRPC, Hono, TanStack Router/Query/Form, React, shadcn/ui, OpenTelemetry, AI SDK, Turborepo, pnpm, and repository CI configuration.
- Compare findings against [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md), [`CLAUDE.md`](../../../CLAUDE.md), [`agent-engine/workflows/README.md`](../../../agent-engine/workflows/README.md), [`agent-engine/workflow-memory/guardrails.md`](../../../agent-engine/workflow-memory/guardrails.md), docs/patterns/*.md, docs/frontend/*.md, docs/testing/*.md, relevant repository-level config, and representative code.
- Produce 3-6 ranked recommendations with impact, effort, confidence, and concrete repo evidence.
- Apply materiality checks: "Do we need this now?" and "What measurable system-level difference does this create?" Drop low-signal ideas.

Issue policy:
- Ensure label availability before issue operations:
  - `gh label create best-practice-researcher --color 0052CC --description "Best-practice random-walk research findings" --force`
- Search open and closed issues plus open PRs before creating anything.
- Reuse/extend existing issues when possible.
- Open up to 3 high-signal non-duplicate issues when confidence >= 0.8.
- Every new issue title must start with `[Best Practice Researcher]`.
- Every new issue must include:
  - Why This Change Makes Sense Now For Humans
  - Recommendation Metadata (rank, impact, effort, confidence)
  - Concrete Repo Scenario (current-state snippet + failure/improvement snippet)
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - Human Approval Gate: implementation only after a human adds the `ready-for-dev` label.
- Prefer adding a `References` section when external docs/research materially strengthen the recommendation.
- If external docs/release notes/papers are cited, the `References` section is required and must include direct clickable URLs with short per-link relevance notes (no placeholder text without links).
- For any issue influenced by external papers, include a Research Trace section with:
  - Paper link(s)
  - Key paper idea(s) selected for this repo
  - Planned adaptation in this codebase (not generic advice)
  - Requirement that implementers append [`research/implemented-ideas.md`](../../../research/implemented-ideas.md) when shipped
- Add labels `best-practice-researcher` and `codex-automation` when available.
- Do not add `ready-for-dev` from this automation; only humans apply that label when an issue is approved for implementation.
- Do not add `self-improvement` from this automation.

Append concise run memory including:
- walk mode
- previous path and chosen path (scope+domain)
- revisit justification when the same path is reused
- coverage snapshot of recent paths (last 8 runs)
- research links
- related issues and new issue URLs
- signal score 1-5
- followability delta
- append at least one structured event:
  - `pnpm workflow-memory:add-entry --workflow "Periodic Scans" ...`
- commit and push memory append artifacts after each run:
  - `pnpm workflow-memory:sync --message "chore(workflow-memory): best-practice-researcher run memory"`
- if `workflow-memory:sync` reports non-fast-forward, allow it to auto-rebase
  append-only memory files and retry; only stop when conflicts include
  non-memory paths.
